# TeamsLeaderboard
Sample project to create a quick leaderboard for a Teams Channel. 
Based on the awesome work of Albert-Jan Schot and his blog post [Recognize active team members with the CLI for Microsoft 365](https://www.cloudappie.nl/recognize-active-team-members-cli-microsoft-365/)

Like Appie we are using a simple modell to score different points depending on users starting a conversation, giving a reaction or replying to others. As always, messages with a subject line get extra points!
